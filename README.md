### RSS aggregator

### Link to my project:
<https://rss-agregator-vert.vercel.app/>

When adding an RSS feed, data is downloaded and displayed.

The page displays a list of posts loaded from each stream.
Each item in this list is a link to a post, where the link text is the title of the post.

The application checks each RSS feed every 5 seconds, and if it contains new posts, it adds them to the list.

### Setup

make install

### Requirements

Node.js version 13 and higher
